# Youtube Albumizer

A command line tool for turning a public Youtube playlist into an album of MP3s.

## This thing looks rough.

Yes, this is litteraly the first version of the tool I cranked out at 2AM
Thursday morning. 

It is ugly, hard to use, and you must hard-code all your options into index.js.  
These options are undocumented and scattered throughout the code. Good luck!

## So, this is it?

Uh, no. I'm polishing it up. I plan to add a Terminal User Interface and some
other quality of life improvements to this.

## Do you have anything else to say for yourself?

For a readme file that I'm writing, this is wierdly judgemental.
